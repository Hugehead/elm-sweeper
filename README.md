# Elm Sweeper

Elm Sweeper aims to reimplement the puzzle mechanics of
[Hexcells](http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/)
as a web application. Hexcells is a supercharged
Minesweeper with hand crafted levels.

Community made levels are collected on
[/r/hexcellslevels](https://www.reddit.com/r/hexcellslevels/).

## Comparison to Hexcells

### Hexcells has

  - Nicer Graphics
  - The original level collection by Matthew Brown
  - Steam integration

### Elm Sweeper has

  - Nothing fancy yet ;-(

### Elm Sweeper might someday have

Just a dump of ideas for this floating around my head.

- Create a link which opens a certain level automatically.
  - .../#decode=FancyUrlEncoding
  - .../#source=https://github.com/rosievers/hexcelllevels/raw/master/l1
  - Maybe even .../#reddit=4y2l34/level_broken_spaceship_mediumhard
  this would link back to the reddit discussion thread from inside Elm Sweeper.
- An integrated level editor. There is already [SixCells](https://github.com/blaxpirit/sixcells) but you have to download it.
- Fade out now useless numbers. Hexcells does this for flowers, but I want it for regular numbers as well (Which is really the reason this whole project got started.)
